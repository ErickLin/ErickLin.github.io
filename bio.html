	<h1 style="font-family:verdana">Bio</h1>

	<p style="font-family:verdana">My interests lie in pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. Recently, I was selected to present my research on Markov regime switching models for human pattern recognition at the National Collegiate Research Conference at Harvard. Look under <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> to find out more about my research.</p>

	<p style="font-family:verdana">I have experience in Java, C++, C, MySQL, and Haskell, as well as Git, Vim, and UNIX/Linux. I fuse practicality and idealism in my work, and my motto is that for anything I don't know, I can learn.</p>

	<p style="font-family:verdana">My hobbies include building applications, participating in programming competitions, running, swimming, watching movies, and thinking deeply about questions and issues.</p>

	<p style="font-family:verdana">Mission Statement: To obtain a research or software engineering internship in the summer of 2016, to graduate with Bachelors degrees in computer science and mathematics by May 2017, and to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science</p>
